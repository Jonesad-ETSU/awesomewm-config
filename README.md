## Introduction to Awesome
Awesomewm, or the Awesome Window Manager, is a minimalist program based on dwm, an even more minimal program designed to manipulate, display, and manage clients in a Linux X server environment. Awesomewm provides a well-defined API for definingcustom widgets, controlling windows, and responding to button presses. This allows for awesome to be used to create User Interfaces that are dynamic and beautiful while still remaining light-weight performance-wise.

## Introduction to my Theme
This theme with the following design ideas:
- Good User Interfaces should improve the workflow of both Power-Users and New Users alike. 
- Good User Interfaces should not take up unnessecary screenspace.
- Good User Interfaces should consist of items that are immediately recognizable in their functionality.
- Good User Interfaces should be consistent with different screen resolutions.
- Good User Interfaces should be easily customizable.
- Good User Interfaces should, well... look nice.
