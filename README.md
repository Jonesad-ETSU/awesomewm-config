# Welcome to my Awesomewm dotfiles

## Introduction to Awesome
Awesomewm, or the Awesome Window Manager, is a minimalist program based on dwm, an even more minimal program designed to manipulate, display, and manage clients in a Linux X server environment. Awesomewm provides a well-defined API for definingcustom widgets, controlling windows, and responding to button presses. This allows for awesome to be used to create User Interfaces that are dynamic and beautiful while still remaining light-weight performance-wise.

## Introduction to my Theme
This theme was designed with the following set of standards:

- Good User Interfaces should improve the workflow of both Power-Users and New Users alike. 
- Good User Interfaces should not take up unnessecary screenspace.
- Good User Interfaces should consist of items that are immediately recognizable in their functionality.
- Good User Interfaces should be consistent with different screen resolutions.
- Good User Interfaces should be easily customizable.
- Good User Interfaces should, well... look nice.
<br/>
In order to tackle these challenges, I took the following steps:

- Remain faithful to both Tiling Window Manager concepts and Floating Window Manager concepts through providing easy to access keybinds and panel buttons to change between different tags and Windows.
- The panel hides itself when the Super Key (Windows button on most keyboards) is not held down and the mouse is not hovering over the panel. It hides itself down to 1/40th of its regular size. 
- Contains easily recognizable symbols and buttons, such as the volume, microphone, and brightness bars, the weather widget with its weather icons, and the music player with its control icons.
- This configuration uses Awesome's beautiful.xresources library to account for the dpi, or dots-per-inch, of the current display, as recognized by xrdb, to determine sizes independent of the actual screen resolution.
